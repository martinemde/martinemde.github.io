# Announcing The Gem Cooperative

_don't put all your gems in one basket_

The former team from rubygems.org is excited to announce a new gem server for the Ruby community:

[https://gem.coop](https://gem.coop)

Right now, the current versions of RubyGems and Bundler work with this new server. All Ruby developers are welcome to switch to using this new server immediately. Just swap your primary source to `https://gem.coop`

The gem.coop server is simple and we aim to keep it that way. We plan to add features that serve to increase security and make packaging blazing fast. We want the default choice to be the secure choice.

## Join us!

You can [join us on the Bundler Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/bundler/shared_invite/zt-3ey89pd2b-gM4LAB8Xr921Ki_SEKAx4w) to get involved in the discussion.

## Questions?

### What is the .coop TLD? Is it about chickens?

Right!? I'm glad you started with a softball question. I think it _should_ be chicken related (logo idea!). The `.coop` or "Co-op" stands for "Cooperative", like REI or a local credit union. It's part of the way we're imagining that we can support ruby packaging in a way that's both sustainable, open, and fair.

### Is it stable?

Gem.coop is served with full, fast, edge caching and all gems are immediately available upon push to rubygems.org

### Can I publish gems to gem.coop?

Not yet. There's an interesting and tricky problem to solve in order to have two divergent public gem servers. This is our focus for the coming months. We know people are excited to have an alternative and we hope to solve this soon.

### How will you handle governance?

We're working on Gem.coop governance with the support of Mike McQuaid, Project Lead of Homebrew. We aim to release publicly later this week.

### Can I donate?

If you're feeling gracious you can always support one or all of [the maintainers on GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/gem-coop/people). It's very kind of you read this question and imagine asking if you could donate. Thank you!

We didn't feel ready to ask anyone for money yet, so if you want to contribute to the project, you can support us by sharing this post and showing your excitement, testing out the server, supporting the team, and generally being a good part of the community.

## Now what?

Join [the mailing list](https://gem.coop) and we'll keep you updated. No corporatespeak, just developers excited about Ruby and Gem packaging.

Thanks to all my teammates that make this possible!
@simi, @segiddins, @indirect, @duckinator, and @deivid-rodriguez
